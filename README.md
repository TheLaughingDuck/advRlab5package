# This repository
A repository for the lab 5 shiny app in the course Advanced programming in R. This repo (despite the name) is not a package. Just a poor name choice.

## Running the shiny app
* Open either RStudio or RGui. In the console, load the `shiny` package.

* Run `runGitHub("TheLaughingDuck/advRlab5package")`.
